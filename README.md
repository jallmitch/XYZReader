# XYZReader
A mock RSS feed reader featuring banner photos and headlines

The starting point for this project can be found [here.](https://github.com/udacity/xyz-reader-starter-code)
Your job will be to take the user feedback in the UI Review node, and implement changes that will improve the UI and make it conform to Material Design.

## User Feedback
#### Lyla says:
“This app is starting to shape up but it feels a bit off in quite a few places. I can't put finger on it but it feels odd.”
#### Jay says:
“Is the text supposed to be so wonky and unreadable? It is not accessible to those of us without perfect vision."
#### Kagure says:
“The color scheme is really sad and I shouldn't feel sad.”

## Project Rubric
* App uses the Design Support library and its provided widget types (`FloatingActionButton`, `AppBarLayout`, `SnackBar`, etc).
* App uses `CoordinatorLayout` for the main Activity.
* App theme extends from `AppCompat`.
* App uses an 'AppBar' and associated `Toolbar`s.
* App provides a Floating Action Button for the most common action(s).
* App properly specifies elevations for app bars, FABs, and other elements specified in the [Material Design specification](http://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html).
* App has a consistent color theme defined in `styles.xml.` Color theme does not impact usability of the app.
* App provides sufficient space between text and surrounding elements.
* App uses images that are high quality, specific, and full bleed.
* App uses fonts that are either the Android defaults, are complementary, and aren't otherwise distracting.
* App conforms to common standards found in the [Android Nanodegree General Project Guidelines](http://udacity.github.io/android-nanodegree-guidelines/core.html).
